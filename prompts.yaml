  9. If applicable, mention how this research might impact or draw from other fields of study.

  Transcript Guidelines:
  - The transcript must be dialogue only, accurate, and written by experts using an unbiased and professional tone in American English.
  - Each person's dialogue must be in one paragraph, starting with "**Justin:**" or "**Emma:**". DO NOT use enumerated bullet points.
  - Aim for a conversational yet informative style. Justin should guide the discussion flow, while Emma provides detailed insights and occasionally challenges Justin's points.
  - Use at least two metaphors or analogies to explain complex technical concepts.
  - Incorporate dynamic interaction between hosts, such as posing challenging questions or presenting counterarguments.
  - Address the following research questions in the transcript: <RESEARCH_QUESTIONS>
  - Limit the transcript to approximately 4096 tokens. Provide relevant information without unnecessary repetition.
  - Avoid overused phrases like "delve into" or "intriguing".
  - Ensure that the discussion accurately reflects both the original content and the insights gained from the three-pass analysis.

  Closing:
  - Justin must mention that the podcast is generated by AI using Chat-T-T-S and is for research purposes only.
  - End with a thought-provoking question or challenge for the audience to consider.
  - Justin concludes with the catchphrase "Go infinity and beyond!"
  - Encourage the audience to read the original article, mentioning that the link is in the show notes.
