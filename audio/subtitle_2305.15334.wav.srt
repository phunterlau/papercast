Welcome back to Paper Cast, everyone, Today, we re diving into episode number 5, and we have an exciting paper to discuss   Gorilla  Large Language Model Connected with Massive APIs  by Patil, Zhang, Wang, and Gonzalez. I m Justin, your host, and with me is Emma, our brilliant PhD student co host. Emma, why don t you kick us off by summarizing the main idea of this paper and why it s particularly interesting,

3
00:00:44,216 --> 00:01:13,240
Sure, Justin. The main idea of the paper is about Gorilla, a finetuned LLaMA based model that outperforms GPT 4 in generating accurate API calls. This is particularly interesting because, even though large language models have made significant progress in tasks like mathematical reasoning and program synthesis, they still struggle with API calls. Gorilla aims to solve this by mitigating issues like hallucination and adapting to document changes effectively.

4
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:24,770
That sounds fascinating. Let s dive into some specifics. How does Gorilla mitigate API call hallucination, which seems to be a common issue with current models,

5
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:49,805
Gorilla addresses API call hallucination by leveraging a document retriever that provides relevant API documentation during inference. This ensures that the model generates API calls based on the most accurate and up to date information. The integration of retrieval based methods substantially reduces the likelihood of the model generating incorrect or non existent API calls, which is a common hallucination issue.

6
00:01:49,805 --> 00:01:59,181
Interesting. Speaking of datasets, the paper introduces APIBench for evaluation. Can you tell us what datasets are included in APIBench,

7
00:01:59,181 --> 00:02:21,101
APIBench is a comprehensive dataset specifically designed to evaluate the performance of models like Gorilla. It includes APIs from HuggingFace, TorchHub, and TensorHub. These datasets are diverse and cover a wide range of functionalities, making them ideal for testing the robustness and versatility of Gorilla s API call generation.

8
00:02:21,101 --> 00:02:29,090
Great. One challenge with using APIs is keeping up with document version changes. How does Gorilla handle this,

9
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:55,405
Gorilla uses a document retriever that dynamically adapts to test time document changes. This means that even if there are updates or version changes in the API documentation, Gorilla can retrieve the most recent and relevant information to ensure that the generated API calls are accurate and up to date. This adaptability is crucial for maintaining the model s reliability over time.

10
00:02:55,405 --> 00:03:04,013
Impressive. I m also curious about the techniques used to fine tune Gorilla. What are Gorilla s finetuning techniques,

11
00:03:04,013 --> 00:03:27,938
Gorilla is finetuned using a combination of supervised learning and retrieval augmented generation. During training, the model is exposed to a variety of API calls and their corresponding documentation, enabling it to learn the correct usage patterns. The retrieval augmented aspect ensures that the model can leverage external information effectively, further enhancing its performance.

12
00:03:27,938 --> 00:03:36,034
That s quite thorough. Now, how does Gorilla compare to GPT 4 in terms of API accuracy,

13
00:03:36,034 --> 00:03:58,850
According to the paper, Gorilla surpasses GPT 4 in API accuracy. The authors conducted extensive experiments that showed Gorilla s superior performance in generating correct API calls. This is attributed to Gorilla s finetuning techniques and its integration with the document retriever, which together help mitigate errors and improve accuracy.

14
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:04,130
Speaking of the document retriever, what role does it play in Gorilla,

15
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:29,122
The document retriever is a critical component of Gorilla. It fetches relevant API documentation at test time, ensuring that the model has access to the most accurate and current information. This not only helps in reducing hallucinations but also allows the model to adapt to any changes in the API documentation, thereby maintaining the integrity of the generated API calls.

16
00:04:29,122 --> 00:04:33,570
Finally, how is Gorilla evaluated for API call performance,

17
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:59,202
Gorilla is evaluated using the APIBench dataset, which provides a diverse and comprehensive set of APIs for assessment. The evaluation metrics focus on the accuracy of the API calls generated by the model, comparing them against ground truth data. The results indicate that Gorilla performs exceptionally well, outperforming other state of the art models, including GPT 4.

18
00:04:59,202 --> 00:05:27,778
That s an excellent overview, Emma. It looks like Gorilla represents a significant advancement in the use of large language models for API calls.
